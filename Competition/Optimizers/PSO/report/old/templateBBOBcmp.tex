%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{1} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.
%
\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

\section{Results}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Results from experiments according to \cite{hansen2010exp} on the benchmark
functions given in \cite{wp200901_2010,hansen2010fun} are presented in
Figures~\ref{fig:ERTratiographs}, \ref{fig:scatterplots} and \ref{fig:RLDs} and
in Table~\ref{tab:ERTs}. The \textbf{expected running time (ERT)}, used in the figures and table, depends on a
given target function value, $\ftarget=\fopt+\Df$, and is computed over all relevant trials
as the number of function evaluations executed during each trial while the best
function value did not reach \ftarget, summed over all trials
and divided by the number of trials that actually reached \ftarget\
\cite{hansen2010exp,price1997dev}. 
\textbf{Statistical significance} is tested with the rank-sum test for a given
target $\Delta\ftarget$ ($10^{-8}$ in Figure~\ref{fig:ERTratiographs}) using,
for each trial, either the number of needed function evaluations to reach
$\Delta\ftarget$ (inverted and multiplied by $-1$), or, if the target was not
reached, the best $\Df$-value achieved, measured only up to the smallest number
of overall function evaluations for any unsuccessful trial under consideration.

ERT ratio % Ratio of the expected running times (ERT) 
of \algone\ divided by \algzero\ versus $\log_{10}(\Df)$ for
$f_1$--$f_{24}$ in
  {\color{cyan}2},

  {\color{magenta}40}-D.
% cyan:2, green:3, blue:5, black:10, red:20, purple:40. 
Ratios $<10^0$ indicate an advantage of \algone, smaller
values are always better. The line gets dashed when for any algorithm the ERT exceeds thrice the median
of the trial-wise overall number of $f$-evaluations for the same algorithm on this function.
Symbols indicate the best achieved $\Df$-value of one algorithm (ERT gets undefined to the right). The dashed line
continues as the fraction of successful trials of the other
algorithm, where 0 means 0\% and the y-axis limits mean 100\%, values below
zero for \algone. The line ends when no algorithm reaches $\Df$ anymore. 
The number of successful trials is given, only if it was in $\{1\dots9\}$ for
\algone\ (1st number) and non-zero for \algzero\ (2nd number). 
Results are significant with $p=0.05$ for one star and $p=10^{-\#\star}$
otherwise, with Bonferroni correction within each figure.}

 \caption{\label{fig:RLDs}Empirical cumulative distributions (ECDF) 
 of run lengths and speed-up ratios in 5-D (left) and 20-D (right). 
 Left sub-columns: ECDF of
 the number of function evaluations divided by dimension $D$
 (FEvals/D) to reach a target value $\fopt+\Df$ with $\Df=10^{k}$, where
 $k\in\{1, -1, -4, -8\}$ is given by the first value in the legend, for
 \algone\ (solid) and \algzero\ (dashed). Light beige lines show the ECDF of
 FEvals for target value $\Df=10^{-8}$ of algorithms benchmarked during
 BBOB-2009. 
 Right sub-columns: ECDF of FEval ratios of \algone\ divided by \algzero, all
 trial pairs for each function. Pairs where both trials failed are disregarded,
 pairs where one trial failed are visible in the limits being $>0$ or $<1$. The
 legends indicate the number of functions that were solved in at least one trial
 (\algone\ first).}

Bold entries are statistically significantly better compared 
to the other algorithm, with $p=0.05$ or $p=10^{-k}$ where $k>1$ is the number 
following the $\star$ symbol, with Bonferroni

\bibliographystyle{abbrv}
\bibliography{bbob}  % bbob.bib is the name of the Bibliography in this case
% You must have a proper ".bib" file
%  and remember to run:
% latex bibtex latex latex
% to resolve all references
% to create the ~.bbl file.  Insert that ~.bbl file into
